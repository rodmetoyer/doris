# doris
Modeling and simulation software for a tethered fluid kinetic-energy extraction device.
Documentation is on the way.

## What to run something
The DualRotorSim.m script is how you run simulation scenarios. Open that file in Matlab and click run and you should see something happen.

## Info
In case you have stumbled on this by accident: This code is still in development. It is not currently meant for public consumption. There are probably bugs. And there is no documentation.
