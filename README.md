Modeling and simulation software for a cabled fluid-energy extraction vehicles

## What to run something
The rotorSim script runs a simualtion for a single rotor turbine. It takes minutes per seconds of simualtion (about 2 minutes to simulate 10 seconds on my machine).

## Info
For now all of the code is just dumped into one place. I'm also keeping random stuff like pdfs from my profiling because I need it and I'm the only one developing right now. I'll clean it up when I have time and\or when it becomes an issue.
