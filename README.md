Modeling and simulation software for a dual-rotor tethered fluid kinetic-energy extraction device.
More documentation is on the way. For now, if you are not working directly with the author then you may have trouble running this code.

## What to run something
The DualRotorSim.m script is how you run simulation scenarios. Open that file in Matlab and click run and you should see something happen. However, you may see something happen for hours and hours. If you are not working directly with the author, you may want to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the classes before you start running code.

## Info (In case you have stumbled on this by accident)
This code is still in development. It is not currently meant for public consumption. There are probably bugs. And there is no documentation. And it is a hacky mess. But it works for our current modeling objectives, we're getting good results, and we are working on publishing those results.
